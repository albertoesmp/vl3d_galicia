        The method that provides the logit to select the values of interest
        from the reduced predictions. It must be overridenn by any concrete
        implementation of a prediction selection strategy.

        :param reducer: The prediction reducer that is doing the reduction.
        :type reducer: :class:`.PredictionReducer`
        :param Z: Matrix-like array. There are as many rows as points and
            as many columns as reduced predictions.
        :return: The selected predictions derived from the reduced predictions
            as a matrix. Either a matrix with the :math:`n_y` point-wise output
            values :math:`\pmb{\hat{Y}} \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n_y}` or a
